We’ll look at a dataset that provides insights into E-Commerce, including product and order records, as well as customer data.We will use BigQuery and Looker to analyze and visualize the data, making it easier for novices.

DATASET:
We are using the E-commerce data set. It includes Order Details, Product Details, Shipping Details, Customer Details, Sales, and Region Data

After importing csv data, BigQuery manages it. Visuals are exported to Looker Studio

Looker Studio :-
We will use various tools such as charts, graphs, filters, trend lines, complex calculations, data segmentation, and visual customisation.
